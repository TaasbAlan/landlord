### HOW TO PLAY


#### Control: 

   1. To play a game you simply touch on the tile on map, then the pop up come out, choose the edge you want to put the fence by touching on it.


#### Rules: 

   - There are two player who compete on one game.
   - *The Island* is split into Grid.
   - Every player will place *the fence* on edge of each square in grid in turn.
   - when square is surrounded by 4 fences, a house will automatically appear on it, the house's color is depend on the player who place the last fence on that square.
   - The one who place the last fence to complete a closed path will score that turn. 
   - In tree mode, player need to chop down the tree before they can place a house on that square.
   - To chop down the tree player will need *AXE* item. *AXE* is randomly hide under some square in map. Each *AXE* is able to take down one tree only.
   - Rocks are the obstacles, they cant be interact.
